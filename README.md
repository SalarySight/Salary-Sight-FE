## Introduction
The primary goal of this project was to showcase all that we have learned Turing in the past seven months, which is a lot. We also worked in collaboration of the back-end/front-end teams for the first time. We had to teach ourselves a new technology during this project as well, so we chose GraphQL.  
We decided to create an application where a user can add their salary information after graduating from Turing. A user can also filter the data on the site to display data from individuals who may have the same experince as them. The specifications for this project can be found [here.](https://mod4.turing.edu/projects/capstone/)


## Goals
* Self teach making requests with GraphQL
* Use CircleCI for Continuous Integration and Delivery. 
* Use TDD - Cypress 
* Create filter options for users to filer salaries to someone with same experince, etc. 
* Easy to navigate UI/UX

#### Future Additions
- Add an option for users to have no gender identity. 
- Add race or ethnicity onto form submission since there is a huge wage gap in STEM Careers. 
- Add more filtering options.
- Add more responsive styling. 
- Add back and forth page arrows so users can only view 15 cards at a time. 
- More error handling for login.
- Allow users to view their data posts on their profile page and delete/edit their posts.
